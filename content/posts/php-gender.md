[The horridness and downright strangeness of PHP](
https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/) has already been written about
extensively, but did you know that someone felt the need to make a gender class? Neither did I,
until today. [Here it is on the PHP manual for your reading pleasure](
https://www.php.net/manual/class.gender.php).

It does... not much it seems. From what I can tell, the main features are:
- Connecting to an external name dictionary
- Getting the perceived gender of a name
- Checking if one name is an alias of another
- Getting similar names

Are more than five people going to use it? Probably not, but still... why?
